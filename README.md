# Python-TODO-list
1. Python Installed
You must have Python 3 installed.

Check by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
If not installed, download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads

✅ 2. The To-Do List File
You need your Python script (e.g., todo.py) saved on your computer.

✅ 3. Terminal or Command Prompt
Open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

Navigate to the folder where the file is saved:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd path/to/your/file
✅ 4. Run the Script
Start the To-Do List app by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
python todo.py
Or if python doesn’t work:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 todo.py
✅ 5. Text File (If Needed)
If your script saves tasks to a .txt file (e.g., tasks.txt), that file will be created or updated automatically.

Just make sure the script and the .txt file (if it exists) are in the same folder.

Created a command-line Python To-Do List app with features to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved using file handling for persistence. Showcases core Python skills like loops, conditionals, user input, and working with files.
